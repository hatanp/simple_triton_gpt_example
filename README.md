Simple example for running text generation and stable diffusion with Hugging Face and custom Python backend with NVIDIA Triton inference server. In case you only want to use other then just delete the relevant files from `server/model_repository`. 

#### Setup

- Run setup.sh at server folder to save model files locally (TODO: make use of proper Hugging Face cache)
